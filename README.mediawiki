==Description==

This plugin allows users to link their Habari blog to G+, using a method described by Joost de Valk in an article on [http://yoast.com/push-rel-author-head/ Yoast].

==Installation==
<ol>
<li>move directory or clone repo into
<pre>BlogRoot/user/plugins/</pre>
<dl>
<dt style="font-weight:bold">BlogRoot</dt><dd>directory where Habari resides</dd>
<dt style="font-weight:bold">user</dt><dd>user directory</dd>
<dt style="font-weight:bold">plugins</dt><dd>plugin directory</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>
<li>Activate plugin</li>
<li>[[#Configure | Configure plugin]]</li>
<ol>

==Configuration==

This plugin requires initial configuration in order to work. Fortunately, there is only one thing to set, which is an id.

To find this id, go to your Google+ profile, preferably while logged out, since the URL looks different, and copy the address from the address bar.

the address while logged in looks like the following:
<pre>
https://plus.google.com/101897488487670181092/posts?partnerid=gplp0
</pre>

the address while logged out looks like this:
<pre>
https://plus.google.com/101897488487670181092/posts
</pre>

This plugin uses the latter format and the textfield in the configuration wants what is between <strong>https://plus.google.com/</strong> and <strong>/posts</strong>, without either of the two included.

==Support==

If you are encountering problems, feel free to let me know at the address below.
